Hi!

This project aims to show, how to use the Claude 3 base model from AWS Bedrock for text generation based on a user_input inside a Jupyter Notebook.

The following libraries are needed to do this project:
- boto3 ( Amazon SDK  for Python scripts)
- json (for API-requests)
- os  and dotenv to set environment variables not displaying private AWS access informations

All steps are explained with commentaries inside the Jupyter Notebook file.
